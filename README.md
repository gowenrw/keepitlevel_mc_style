# KeepItLevel Minecolonies Style Pack

This is the KeepItLevel Minecolonies Style Pack by @alt_bier a.k.a. Richard Gowen

I created this style pack because I have an obsession with keeping my colonies nice and level with standard hut size templates for nice stright roads and rail.

I took inspiration from how the [Thurloe style pack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/minecolonies-thurloe-style-pack/) dealt with hut sizes and used that idea to make fully standardized template sizes of small medium and large that all my schematics adhere to.

The core features of the KeepItLevel Style Pack are the platform decks in small medium and large sizes and the raised roads/rail that have been designed to fit around them.  All huts have been designed to the platform deck sizes and have a variant which includes the deck beneath the hut.  All decorations/fields/walls/etc. have been designed to the platform deck sizes as well, allowing the entire colony to be built on raised platforms.

To make it easier on myself as well as anyone else using this style pack I put together a datapack which teaches the appropriate colonists all the recipies they need to build all the vanilla and D.O. components used in this style.  Less time spent teaching recipies means more time spent managing your colony.

## Installation

To install this style pack, download the latest blueprint zip file [keepitlevel_stylepack.zip](/blueprints/keepitlevel_stylepack.zip) and UNZIP it into your blueprint folder per [these Minecolonies instructions](https://minecolonies.com/wiki/tutorials/schematics#how-do-i-install-custom-schematics-i-just-downloaded).

To install the optional datapack that supports this style, download the latest blueprint zip file [keepitlevel_datapack.zip](/datapacks/keepitlevel_datapack.zip) COPY it (No need to unzip) into your World Save datapacks folder per [these Minecraft instructions](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Installing_a_data_pack).  Note that Data packs exist as part of a specific world.  So unlike stylepack blueprints, datapacks must be installed in each world save directory you wish it to be active on.
