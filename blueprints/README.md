# Blueprints

This directory contains the KeepItLevel blueprints and related files.

The file ```keepitlevel_stylepack.zip``` is a release archive of the ```keepitlevel``` directory.
This is the file you should UNZIP into your Minecraft Minecolonies blueprint folder to use this style.

There are several batch files here that I use to copy the scan files and build the release archive zip and deploy it to my test environment.
