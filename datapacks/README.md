# Datapacks

This directory contains the KeepItLevel datapack and related files.

The file ```keepitlevel_datapack.zip``` is a release archive of the ```keepitlevel``` directory.
This is the file you should COPY (No need to unzip) into your Minecraft Minecolonies Game Save datapacks folder to use this datapack.

There are several batch files here that I use to build the release archive zip and deploy it to my test environment.
