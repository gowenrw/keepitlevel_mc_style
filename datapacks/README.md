# Datapacks

This directory contains the KeepItLevel datapack and related files.

There are two different versions of this datapack based on the Minecraft version you are playing on (there were major recipe format changes in minecraft 1.21+)

For Minecraft 1.20 the KeepItLevel datapack files are in the directory ```mc1.20.1``` which contains:
* The ```templates``` directory which contains templates for DO recipes
* The ```keepitlevel``` directory which contains the datapack files
* The datapack zipfile [keepitlevel_datapack.zip](https://github.com/gowenrw/keepitlevel_mc_style/raw/refs/heads/main/datapacks/mc1.20.1/keepitlevel_datapack.zip).
* Several batch files used to build the zip file and other tasks.

For Minecraft 1.21 the KeepItLevel datapack files are in the directory ```mc1.21.1``` which contains:
* The ```templates``` directory which contains templates for DO recipes
* The ```keepitlevel``` directory which contains the datapack files
* The datapack zipfile [keepitlevel_datapack.zip](https://github.com/gowenrw/keepitlevel_mc_style/raw/refs/heads/main/datapacks/mc1.21.1/keepitlevel_datapack.zip).
* Several batch files used to build the zip file and other tasks.

My research notes regarding the creation of this datapack are in the file ```datapack_info.md```
